# Introduction
Implementation of the Coco-annotator annotation tool. The annotation tool is originally found here: [link](https://github.com/jsbroks/coco-annotator).

This version implements both the [MaskRCNN](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) and [Maskformer](https://github.com/facebookresearch/MaskFormer) models and deploys to AWS beanstalk using the docker-compose build.
